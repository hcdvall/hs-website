        The island has been home to the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Queen Victoria built her summer residence and final home, Osborne House at East Cowes, on the Isle. It has a maritime and industrial tradition of boat-building, sail-making, the manufacture of flying boats, hovercraft, and Britain's space rockets. The island hosts annual music festivals, including the Isle of Wight Festival, which in 1970 was the largest rock music event ever held.[6] It has well-conserved wildlife and some of the richest cliffs and quarries of dinosaur fossils in Europe.

        The island has played an important part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, and has been near the front-line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada and weathered the Battle of Britain. Rural for most of its history, its Victorian fashionability and the growing affordability of holidays led to significant urban development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
        Historically part of Southampton, the island became a separate administrative county in 1890. It continued to share the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire until 1974, when it was made its own ceremonial county. The Isle no longer has administrative links to Hampshire, though the two counties share their police force and fire and rescue service, and the island's Anglican churches belongs to the Diocese of Portsmouth (originally Winchester). A combined local authority with Portsmouth and Southampton was considered,[7] but was unlikely to proceed as of 2017.[8]

        The Isle of Wight (/waÉªt/) is a county and the largest and second-most populous island of England. It is located in the English Channel, two to five miles off the coast of Hampshire, from which it is separated by the Solent. Referred to as 'The Island' by residents[citation needed], the island has resorts that have been popular holiday destinations since Victorian times. It is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. The island is historically part of Hampshire,[5] and is designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
